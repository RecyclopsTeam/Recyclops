Our app is Recyclops. It's purpose is to get people thinking about the waste they are generating 
when they purchase products, and provide them with the necessary information for them to make more 
environmentally-conscious purchases. Users can scan the barcode of a product, and then we pull data 
from our server to display the material(s) of the scanned product, and how it must be disposed 
(trash, recycling, compost, etc). Users can also view a chart that shows their waste trends over 
time, encouraging them to minimize their landfill waste and opt for more recyclable products instead. 
The app also serves as a reference,s o users can scan an item when they are ready to dispose of it, 
to make sure they are disposing of it in the proper manner.
